How might a non-impaired user might benefit from increased web accessibility (that isn’t already discussed above)?

- Non-impaired users can benefit from different means of content delivery, such as transcripts meant for hearing-impaired
  users, or audio readings meant for visually-impaired users. Some users may simply prefer to read the contents of a
  video, or listen to the contents of a page. Non-impaired users can also benefit from forms that alert the of their
  mistakes. Being able to clearly know which fields needs to be edited allow users to have a quicker experience. Speed
  of use can also be improved for non-impaired users by placing page content into related clusters, separated from each
  other. This makes it easier to digest the content on a page at a quick glance.

What are three design choices that User Inyerface made that harmed your user experience?
Explain how you would alter each design choice to improve accessibility and usability.

- The first design choice that made User Inyerface hard to work with was the sample texts in each of the text fields.
  Although on the surface it made it easier to know what to put in each field, the text did not disappear when the field
  was selected; it had to be deleted. This necessitated deleting the sample text in every text box. The second design
  choice that made User Inyerface hard to work with was unclear position of elements. When doing the human verification,
  there were check boxes above and below each image, between each row. Depending on how far down the page is scrolled
  it was hard to tell whether the corresponding check boxes were above or below the images. Grouping them together with
  a common border/background would make it more clear. The third design choice that made User Inyerface hard to work
  with was annoying popups. Every minute, a popup would appear, telling you to speed up. The "close" button was just
  regular text, with no box or underlining. In addition, the font color was very similar to the background. Initially,
  I thought these popups were a "time out" message and restarted the sign-up entirely.

What are three changes you made to your site to increase your Lighthouse (or other) audit score?
Explain how each change increases your site’s performance or accessibility.

- The first change I made was giving each of my HTML elements unique IDs. This allows assistive technologies, such as
  screen readers, to properly read the page. With duplicate IDs, all but the first element with a given ID may be
  ignored by such technologies. The second change I made was adding a [lang] tag to my HTML pages. This allows users
  whose default browser language is not English to know that the page is in English, which can aid the use of automatic
  translation tools. The third change I made was to add a <meta> tag to my HTML pages. These help with search engine
  optimization, letting search engines know directly what types of content my pages have. In turn, this makes it easier
  for potential users to find my page.
